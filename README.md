## Browser support

* Chrome *(latest 2)*
* Firefox *(latest 2)*
* Internet Explorer 8+
* Opera *(latest 2)*

*This doesn't mean that HTML5 Boilerplate cannot be used in older browsers,
just that we'll ensure compatibility with the ones mentioned above.*

If you need legacy browser support (IE 6+, Firefox 3.6+, Safari 4+) you
can use [HTML5 Boilerplate v4](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/tree/v4),
but is no longer actively developed.
